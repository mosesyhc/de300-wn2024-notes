    "A group of researchers {cite:p}`chan2016factors` is studying the financial burden of hospital readmissions after a total knee arthroplasty.  They are interested in the following questions:  \n",
    "1. Do patients undergoing *total knee arthroplasty* get readmitted within a month (30 days) and within 3 months (90 days)?\n",
    "2. How much do these patients in 1. incur during readmission?\n",
    "3. Are these readmissions predictable?\n",
    "4. Are these readmissions preventable?\n",
    "5. Can we predict the costs incurred by a patient, if they were readmitted?\n",

    "*Why these questions?*"
