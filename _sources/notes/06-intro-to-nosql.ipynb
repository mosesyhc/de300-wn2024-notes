    "## What is NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "The term NoSQL refers to a variety of database systems that *do not* follow all the rules in a relational (SQL) database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL typically stands for *not only SQL* or non-relational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL systems:\n",
    "- Apache Cassandra: commerce, recommandation systems\n",
    "- MongoDB: text-based content\n",
    "- Redis: queues, messaging\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Many of these systems can handle most of the applications listed.  Their *main* use case is listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features of NoSQL  \n",
    "1. (Horizontal) scalability: distribute operations over many nodes\n",
    "2. Redundancy: replicate and distribute data over many nodes\n",
    "3. Flexibility:\n",
    "   - looser restriction on concurrency than most relational database systems\n",
    "   - ability to add new features/attributes (columns) dynamically"
