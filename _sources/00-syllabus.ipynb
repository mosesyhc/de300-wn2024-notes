    "### Inclusivity\n",
    "\n",
    "This course strives to be an inclusive learning community, respecting those of differing backgrounds and beliefs. As a community, we aim to be respectful to all students in this class, regardless of race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Northwestern University is committed to providing the most accessible learning environment as possible for students with disabilities. Should you anticipate or experience disability-related barriers in the academic setting, please contact AccessibleNU to move forward with the university's established accommodation process (e: [accessiblenu\\@northwestern.edu](mailto:accessiblenu@northwestern.edu){.email}; p: 847-467-5530).

To that end, the [policy on academic accommodations](https://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies-procedures/classwork-curricular-policies/accommodations-for-religious-holidays.html) for religious holidays stipulates that students will not be penalized for class absences to observe religious holidays. If you will observe a religious holiday during a class meeting, scheduled exam, or assignment deadline, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably within the first two week of class. If exams or assignment deadlines on the syllabus fall on religious holidays you observe, please reach out so that we can discuss that coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Office Hour\n",
    "\n",
    "Weekly office hours are a dedicated time that the teaching team is available to answer your questions, discuss course content, and generally be of support. If none of the offered times in the syllabus works for you, please email the instructor to schedule an appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework and Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to work together on labs and homeworks, but each student must turn in their own assignment and not an exact duplicate of someone else's solutions. The lowest lab will be dropped in calculating your final grades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any late assignment will receive a 20% penalty.  No late assignment is accepted after 72 hours of the due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab attendance is not mandatory, although you are encouraged to do the labs during the assigned lab time so the teaching team can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communications\n",
    "\n",
    "[Canvas](https://canvas.northwestern.edu), where the syllabus, class announcements, exams, notes, and assignments are posted.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G08D5A721), where forum-style discussion and Q/As can happen in the class feed.  You will receive an invitation email in the first week of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Email, through which formal communications happen, e.g., accommodation, progress discussion.  The teaching team observes a 24-hour response policy.  Questions about assignments should be directed to Campuswire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regrade Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "In a case where you believe your assignment or exam is misgraded, submit a regrade request via <https://forms.gle/1Kgx1QookPe65MNh6>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please observe the following instructions when submitting your request:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Please be polite and professional. Mistakes happen, and we will make every effort to ensure everyone gets the grade they earned.\n",
    "-   Submit **one** form per assignment or exam.\n",
    "-   All regrade requests should be submitted within **48 hours** from when the assignment or exam is returned to you. After the time period, the regrade request will not be processed.\n",
    "-   Amount of point deductions is not eligible for regrade.\n",
    "-   Your entire assignment may be regraded. It is possible to lose points if the regrade uncovers further mistakes.\n",
    "-   Do not modify an answer and request regrading. You may receive a failing grade for the class, and may be reported for academic dishonesty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The professor, any TAs, any peer mentors, and the students are expected to abide by all rules and regulations put in place by the Northwestern University, the School of Engineering and the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative AI Policy\n",
    "In this course, you are generally allowed to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI). Any use of GAI should be accompanied by a disclosure at the end of an assignment explaining (1) what you used GAI for; (2) the specific tool(s) you used; and (3) what prompts you used to get the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "The grading scale is predetermined so as to eliminate competition with other students, and to ensure that you always know your grade in the class. Your grade is based upon your performance only.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Numerical Range | Grade |\n",
    "|-----------------|:------|\n",
