    "### I. Clean up dataset\n",
    "1. Rename column names such that only alphabets, numbers, and underscores are retained.\n",
    "2. Consolidate the `['appetizer', 'breakfast', 'brunch', 'dessert', 'lunch', 'dinner']` columns as one column named `food_category`.  If the record does not fall under any of the categories, use the label `'other'` in the `food_category` column.\n",
    "3. Except `title`, `rating`, `calories`, `protein`, `fat`, and `sodium` columns, the other columns should contain binary variables.  Filter out records that do not comply.\n",
    "4. For the continuous columns, verify that the values are numeric. Filter out records that do not comply.\n",
    "5. Analyze the continuous columns for any missing data or outliers. Filter out, impute, or replace unreasonable values.\n",
    "6. For the binary columns (typically indicating presence of ingredients, among other unuseful information), impute the missing values.\n",

    "### II. Construct classification model for recipes\n",
    "1. Give a brief description of the cleaned dataset.  You are *not* required to report about every single column.  Instead, report what you find are important in understanding this dataset.\n",
    "2. If a binary column is predominantly 0 or 1 (> 99%), preclude it from your classification model.\n",

    "   3. Provide a possible meal plan such that the total calories do not exceed 2000 kcal.  *You can suggest any sorts of solution.  Explain your rationale.*"
